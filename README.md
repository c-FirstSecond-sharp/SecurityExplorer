# SecurityExplorer
Windows Explorer-based interface for viewing file and folder security

![SecurityExplorer screenshot](screenshot.png)

Currently incomplete - right now, the app will prompt for a folder (including the root of a drive) and display the files and folders inside it via a treeview, but it does nothing more.

The intention is to show the security permissions per file and folder, and to highlight those which differ from their parent so you can easily locate and adjust them.

This is for use by systems administrators, say, when you inherit a company's fileshare that has multitudes of differing permissions all over and you want to get a hold of what's going on.
